# openpilot Speed Controller App

#### This is an app that can send SSH requests to your comma.ai EON to control your car's speed with a Bluetooth button.

#### If you would like to install the app without compiling yourself, a debugging apk can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/op-speed-controller/blob/master/app-debug.apk?raw=true).

Note: This app is a work-in-progress. It is not finished.
